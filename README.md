## About The Project
The explosion of cryptocurrencies(cryptos) in recent years have the whole world over interested in investing in crypto. At the moment. in our estimation, crypto is too volatile and risky for anyone to want to go all in crypto i.e. a Crypto Maximalist but we do believe it can be a very important part of an investment portfolio. This main goal of this project is to determine if there's a way to derisk / minimize the risks of investing crypto. One such way would be to invest in cryptos that aren't strongly related to Tech stocks namely (FAANGMULA).
