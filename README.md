## About The Project
The explosion of cryptocurrencies(cryptos) in recent years have the whole world over interested in investing in crypto. At the moment. in our estimation, crypto is too volatile and risky for anyone to want to go all in crypto i.e. a Crypto Maximalist but we do believe it can be a very important part of an investment portfolio. This main goal of this project is to determine if there's a way to derisk / minimize the risks of investing crypto. One such way would be to invest in cryptos that aren't strongly related to Tech stocks namely (FAANGMULA).

This app allows its users to select a single or a group cryptocurrencies to view its over time and to access its correlation to Tech Stocks. This app also includes a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast future performance of their portfolio based on the allocations within their portfolio. The SPY500 is the baseline for the portfolio performance analysis as we believe the SPY500 returns should be the absolute lowest any custom portfolio should return. 

It is our goal that investors will be able to use this application, with its vizualization tools and other features to make decisions that are best aligned to their individual investment goals.
